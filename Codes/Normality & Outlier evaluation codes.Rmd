## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Load the data files
ML_ToxPi <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = T)

```


```{r}
#Assess the normality of the data by Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(ML_ToxPi$ToxPi_scores)

#Assess the normality of the data by Q-Q plot
ggqqplot(ML_ToxPi$ToxPi_scores, title = "ToxPi scores")

#Assess the normality of the data by Density plot
ggdensity(ML_ToxPi$ToxPi_scores, main = "Density plot of ToxPi scores",
          xlab = "ToxPi scores")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)   # For visualization
library(dplyr)     # For data manipulation
library(stats)     # For statistical functions like IQR


# Univariate Outlier Detection
# Method 1: Using boxplot statistics
boxplot_outliers <- function(x) {
  Q1 <- quantile(x, 0.25)
  Q3 <- quantile(x, 0.75)
  IQR <- Q3 - Q1
  lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
  return(which(x < lower_bound | x > upper_bound))
}

# Checking for outliers in a specific column
outliers_ToxPi_scores <- boxplot_outliers(ML_ToxPi$ToxPi_scores)
cat("Outliers in 'ToxPi_scores':", outliers_ToxPi_scores, "\n")

# Method 2: Using z-scores (standard deviation-based)
z_score_outliers <- function(x) {
  z_scores <- scale(x) # Standardize the values
  return(which(abs(z_scores) > 3)) # Threshold is usually 3
}

outliers_z_ToxPi_scores <- z_score_outliers(ML_ToxPi$ToxPi_scores)
cat("Z-score based outliers in 'ToxPi_scores':", outliers_z_ToxPi_scores, "\n")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
