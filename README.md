# ml_ToxPi: Prioritization of Organic Micropollutants in Groundwater Using ToxPi and Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the code and scripts used for the manuscript entitled:
"Prioritizing Organic Micropollutants in Groundwater Contaminated from Multiple Sources Using GC-HRMS-Based Suspect and Non-Target Screening (SNTS)."
The study aims to provide a robust prioritization framework by combining ToxPi and machine learning models,
optimizing the weighting factors to reliably rank contaminants according to their environmental significance and health risk potential.


# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to identify and prioritize organic micropollutants in groundwater samples from various
contamination sources using ToxPi and several machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF),
support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).
The dataset used was generated through GC-HRMS-based suspect and non-target screening (SNTS)
and optimized to produce a more objective and reliable ranking of high-priority contaminants.
